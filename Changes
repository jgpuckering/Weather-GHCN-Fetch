Revision history for Perl module libary Windows-GHCN-Fetch

v0.0.012       ????-??-??
  - 91_ghcn_fetch.t failed on perl 5.30.1 -- may be a spurious failure due to clipboard update timing
    - added sleep 1 to give the clipboard more time to update
    - made this a soft failure so the entire build doesn't get flagged red (failed)

v0.0.011       2022-11-21
  - restored printing of reasons for rejection
  - improved warnings for filter and active range missing data
  - refactored StationTable _report_gaps to create _find_gaps
  - added quality % column to missing data reporting, and related improvements
  - for API use, provided an optional parameter to StationTable::load_stations to receive the station text
  - corrected some API POD related to the now defunct user_options and profile_options hashes in set_options
  - eliminated multiple declarations of $PROFILE_FILE
  - moved _get_profile_options and _get_profile_filespec from StationTable to Options
  - renamed _get_profile_options and _get_profile_filespec to get_profile_options and get_profile_filespec
  - moved testing of get_profile_options and get_profile_filespec from 22 to 14_options.t
  - added a cache maintenance utility script (ghcn_cache)
  - removed check for valid cachedir that was preventing ghcn_fetch working without a cache
  - eliminated uninitialized warning in kml report when a station active range has only one value (i.e. end = start)
  - fixed a problem causing ghcn_fetch to croak when both -cachedir and -profile are empty strings
  - fixed 91_ghcn_fetch.t 'output to clipboard' test, which was failing during dzil release

v0.0.008       2022-10-18

  - added GitHub Actions configuration from Gabor Szabo, for CI testing
  - added t\ghcn_cache to the git repository
  - made filepaths for -profile and -cachedir relative to the current working directory
