ghcn_cacheutil - Manage the cache used by ghcn_fetch

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ghcn_cacheutil [-location <dir>] [-couuntry <str>] [-state <str>]
                   [-remove] [-invert|v]
                   [-cachedir <dir>] [-profile <file>] [-outclip]

    ghcn_cacheutil [--help | -? | --usage]

=head1 DESCRIPTION



=head1 PARAMETERS

Getoptions::Long is used, so either - or -- may be used.  Parameter
names may be abbreviated, so long as they remains unambiguous.  Flag
options may appear after filenames.

=over 4

=item -country <str>

Filter the station list to include only those from a specific
country.  The string can be a 2-character GEC (formerly FIPS)
country code, a 3-character UN country code, or a 3-character
internet country code (including the dot).  Longer strings are
treated as a pattern and matched (unanchored) against country names.

=item -state <str> (or -province)

Filter the station list to include only those within the specified
2-character US state or Canadian province code.

=item -location <str>

Filter the station list to include only those whose name matches the
specified pattern.  For a starts-with match, prefix the pattern with
^ (or \A).  For an ends-with match, suffix the pattern with $ (or \Z).

You can also specify a station id (e.g. CA006105978) or a
comma-delimited list of station id's (e.g. CA006105978,USC00336346).

As a handy shortcut, mappings between user-defined names and a station
id or id list can be defined in the locations section of .ghcn_fetch.yaml.

-item -invert

Invert the -location selection criteria; i.e. select those stations
where the pattern doesn't match.

=item -remove

Remove the listed items from the cache, with the exception of items that
correspond to aliases in the user profile.

=item -cachedir <dir>

This section defines the location of the cache directory where pages 
fetched from the NOAA GHCN repository will be saved, in accordance 
with your -refresh option. Using a cache vastly improves the 
performance of subsequent invocations of B<ghcn_fetch>, especially when 
using the same station filtering criteria.

=item -profile <filespec>

Location of the optional user profile YAML file, which can be used
to define location aliases and set commonly used options such as
-cachefile.  Defaults to ~/.ghcn_fetch.yaml.
