ghcn_cacheutil - Manage the cache used by ghcn_fetch

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ghcn_cacheutil [-location <dir>] [-couuntry <str>] [-state <str>]
                   [-invert|v] [-above <int>] [-below <int>]
                   [-remove] [-clean]
                   [-cachedir <dir>] [-profile <file>] [-outclip]

    ghcn_cacheutil [--help | -? | --usage]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script provides an easy way to manage the cache used by ghcn_fetch
(or other applications using the Weather::GHCN::StationTable modules).

Without any parameters, ghcn_cacheutil will list the files in the 
default cache, as defined in the user profile file (typically 
~/.ghcn_fetch.yaml).  You can also specify the profile file or the
cache directory using parameters.

There are two kinds of cached files:  .txt files that contain station
metadata, and .dly files which contain daily weather data for a specific
station.  The .txt files are normally excluded from the list since
it usually makes sense to keep these files around for reuse.  

The script provides selection parameters similar to ghcn_fetch so
that the list of stations can be filtered by country, state (or province),
and location name (or station id).  

The -remove option will remove the files that are listed.  

For example, if you've just done some analysis of stations in Maine and
don't plan to reuse that data in the near future, you can clean up
the cache using ghcn_cacheutil -country US -state ME -remove.

Typically, you'll use filtering options to see a list of files, 
adjusting the filters until you have the list of files you want to 
remove.  Then you'll repeat the command, adding -remove to do the 
cleanup.

The -clean option will remove all files from the cache.


=head1 PARAMETERS

Getoptions::Long is used, so either - or -- may be used.  Parameter
names may be abbreviated, so long as they remains unambiguous.  Flag
options may appear after filenames.

=over 4

=item -country <str>

Filter the station list to include only those from a specific
country.  The string can be a 2-character GEC (formerly FIPS)
country code, a 3-character UN country code, or a 3-character
internet country code (including the dot).  Longer strings are
treated as a pattern and matched (unanchored) against country names.

=item -state <str> (or -province)

Filter the station list to include only those within the specified
2-character US state or Canadian province code.

=item -location <str>

Filter the station list to include only those whose name matches the
specified pattern.  For a starts-with match, prefix the pattern with
^ (or \A).  For an ends-with match, suffix the pattern with $ (or \Z).
Matching is case-insensitive.

You can also specify a station id (e.g. CA006105978) or a
comma-delimited list of station id's (e.g. CA006105978,USC00336346).

As a handy shortcut, mappings between user-defined names and a station
id or id list can be defined in the locations section of .ghcn_fetch.yaml.

-item -invert

Invert the -location selection criteria; i.e. select those stations
where the pattern doesn't match.

=item -remove

Remove the listed items from the cache, with the exception of items that
correspond to aliases in the user profile.  All items will be reported
with the word "removed" before the location name.  You should list
the files first and visually verify they are the ones you want to
remove before using this option.

=item -above <int>

Select cache files where the size is greater than <int>.

=item -below <int>

Select cache files where the size is less than <int>.

=item -clean

Remove all files from the cache.

=item -cachedir <dir>

This section defines the location of the cache directory where pages 
fetched from the NOAA GHCN repository will be saved, in accordance 
with your -refresh option. Using a cache vastly improves the 
performance of subsequent invocations of B<ghcn_fetch>, especially when 
using the same station filtering criteria.

=item -profile <filespec>

Location of the optional user profile YAML file, which can be used
to define location aliases and set commonly used options such as
-cachefile.  Defaults to ~/.ghcn_fetch.yaml.
