=head1 NAME

Weather::GHCN::CacheURI - URI page fetch with file-based caching

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Weather::GHCN::CacheURI;

    # put files cached by fetch() in $cachedir and refresh if not changed this year
    my $cache_uri = Weather::GHCN::CacheURI->new($cachedir, 'yearly');

    $cache_uri->clean_cache;    # empty the cache

    # this will cause fetch to do a network access
    my ($from_cache, $content) = $cache_uri->fetch($uri);

    # depending on the refresh option, this will either fetch the content
    # from the cache, or get a fresher copy from the network
    my ($from_cache, $content) = $cache_uri->fetch($uri);

    # fetch calls these to access the cached file according to the
    # refresh rule and the state of the cached file and the web page

    my $content = $cache_uri->loca($uri);
    $cache_uri->store($uri, $content);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This cache module enables callers to fetch web pages and store the
content on the filesystem so that it can be retrieved subsequently
without a network access.

Unlike caching performed by Fetch::URI or LWP, no Etags or
Last-Modified-Date or other data is included with the content data.
This metadata can be an obstacle to platform portability.
Essentially, just utf-8 page content that is stored.  That should be
neutral enough that the cache file can be used on another platform.
This is a benefit to unit testing, because tests can be constructed
to fetch pages, and the cached pages can be packaged with the tests.
This allows the tests to run faster, and without network access.

The approach is simple, and geared towards accessing and caching
the content of the NOAA GHCN weather repository.  The files in that
repository are simple ASCII files with uncomplicated names.  The
caching algorithm simply strips off the URI path and stores the file
using the filename found in the repository; e.g. 'ghcnd-stations.txt' or
'CA006105887.dly'.  All files are kept in the cache directory, since
all filenames are expected to be unique.

=head1 FIELDS

=head2 cachedir

Returns the cache location defined when the object was instantiated.

=head2 refresh

Returns the refresh option that was defined when the object was
instantiated.  See new(),

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new ($cachedir, $refresh)

New instances of this class must be provided a location for the cache
files upon creation ($cachedir).  This directory must exist or the
new() will fail.  Similarly, $refresh must be a valid value, one of:

=over 4

=item refresh 'yearly'

The origin HTTP server is contacted and the page refreshed if the
cached file has not been changed within the current year. The
rationale for this, and for this being the default, is that the GHCN
data for the current year will always be incomplete, and that will
skew any statistical analysis and so should normally be truncated.
If the user needs the data for the current year, they should use a
refresh value of 'always' or a number.

=item refresh 'never'

The origin HTTP is never contacted, regardless of the page being in
cache or not. If the page is missing from cache, the fetch method will
return undef. If the page is in cache, that page will be returned, no
matter how old it is.

=item refresh 'always'

If a page is in the cache, the origin HTTP server is always checked for
a fresher copy

=item refresh <number>

The origin HTTP server is not contacted if the page is in cache
and the cached page was inserted within the last <number> days.
    Otherwise the server is checked for a fresher page.

=head2 clean_cache

Removes all the files in the cache, but leaves the cache directory.
Returns a list of errors for any files that couldn't be removed.

=cut

method clean_cache () {
    my $re = qr{ \A ( ghcnd-\w+[.]txt | \w+[.]dly ) \Z }xms;
    my @files = path($_cachedir)->children( $re );
    my @errors;
    foreach my $f (@files) {
        try {
            $f->remove;
        } catch {
            push @errors, "*E* unable to remove $f: $_";
        };
    }
    return @errors;
}

=head2 clean_data_cache

Removes all the daily weather data files (*.dly) from the cache, but
leaves the cache directory.  Returns a list of errors for any files
that couldn't be removed.

=cut

method clean_data_cache () {
    # delete the daily weather data files in the cache
    my $re = qr{ \A \w+[.]dly \Z }xms;
    my @files = path($_cachedir)->children( $re );

        } catch {
            push @errors, "*E* unable to remove $f: $_";
        };
    }
    return @errors;
}

=head2 clean_station_cache

Removes the station list and station inventory files (ghcnd-*.txt)
from the cache, but leaves the cache directory. Returns a list of
errors for any files that couldn't be removed.

=cut

method clean_station_cache () {
    # delete the station list and inventory files in the cache
    my $re = qr{ \A ghcnd-\w+[.]txt \Z }xms;
    my @files = path($_cachedir)->children( $re );
    my @errors;
    foreach my $f (@files) {
        try {
            $f->remove;
        } catch {
            push @errors, "*E* unable to remove $f: $_";
        };
    }
    return @errors;
}

=head2 fetch ($uri, $refresh="yearly")

Fetch the web page given by the URI $uri, returning its content
and caching it.  If a cached entry for it exists, and is current
according to the refresh option, then the cached entry is returned.

=cut

method fetch ($uri) {

    my $from_cache;
    my $content;

    carp '*W* no cache directory specified therefore no caching of HTTP queries available'
        if not $_cachedir;

    carp '*W* cache location specified but doesn\'t exist, therefore no caching of HTTP queries available'
        if $_cachedir and not -d $_cachedir;

    if (not $_cachedir or not -d $_cachedir) {
        ($from_cache, $content) = $self->_fetch_without_cache($uri);
        return ($from_cache, $content);
    }

    if ($_refresh eq 'always') {
        ($from_cache, $content) = $self->_fetch_refresh_always($uri);
    }
    elsif ($_refresh eq 'never') {
        ($from_cache, $content) = $self->_fetch_refresh_never($uri);
    }
    elsif ($_refresh eq 'yearly') {
        my $cutoff_mtime = localtime->truncate( to => 'year' );
        ($from_cache, $content) = $self->_fetch_refresh_n_days($uri, $cutoff_mtime);
    } else {
        croak unless $_refresh =~ m{ \A \d+ \Z }xms;
        my $cutoff_mtime = localtime->truncate( to => 'day') - ( $_refresh * $ONE_DAY );
        ($from_cache, $content) = $self->_fetch_refresh_n_days($uri, $cutoff_mtime);
    }

    return ($from_cache, $content);
}

=head2 load ($uri)

Load a previously fetched and stored $uri from the file cache and
returns the content.  Uses Path::Tiny->slurp_utf8, which will lock
the file during the operation and which uses a binmode of
:unix:encoding(UTF-8) for platform portability of the files.

=cut

method load ($uri) {
    my $file = $self->_path_to_key($uri);

    if ( defined $file && -f $file ) {
        return _read_file($file);
    } else {
        return;
    }
}

=head2 store ($uri, $content)

Stores content obtained from a URI using fetch() into a file in the
cache.  The filename is derived from the tail end of the URI.

Uses Path::Tiny->spew_utf8, which writes data to the file atomically.
The file is written to a temporary file in the cache directory, then
renamed over the original.

A binmode of :unix:encoding(UTF-8) (i.e. PerlIO::utf8_strict) is
used, unless Unicode::UTF8 0.58+ is installed. In that case, the content
will be encoded by Unicode::UTF8 and written using spew_raw.

The idea is to store data in a platform-neutral fashion, so cached
files can be used for unit testing on multiple platforms.

=cut

method store ($uri, $content) {

    croak '*E* cache directory doesn\'t exist: ' . $_cachedir
        unless -d $_cachedir;

    my $store_file = $self->_path_to_key($uri);
    return if not defined $store_file;

    # path($dir)->make_path( $dir, mode => $_dir_create_mode )
        # if not -d $dir;

    _write_file( $store_file, $content );
}

# method purge_cache($mtime) {
    # delete daily data files older than $mtime
# }

=head2 remove ($uri)

Remove the cache file associated with this URI.

=cut

    my $file = $self->_path_to_key($uri)
        or return;
    unlink $file;
